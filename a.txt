60 degree arc, bow it, duplicate it, and add another arc in the 3rd dimension, organic share, a pulse of frequency, leaf, sead, eye
smallest geometric solid possible, 3 faces, 2 points - trion re
radiate 12 trion rays in 60 degrees (as an angle of deflection) from  a centre, connecting the 12 outer points,
...result - 4 perfect orbits, as though circling the nucleus of an atom
...60...3...12
if using straight lines to connect the points - the most elemental, perfectly balanced, geometric solid - Buckminster Fuller called it the Vector Equilibrium or the very
geometry of creation
add all 36 arcs, each 60 degress sum 2160, same as an astrological age
2160 * 12 = 25920

Earth's orbital velocity - 66,600 mph
29.78km/s = 18.5 miles/sec
18.5 miles/sec * 60 = 1110 miles/min
1110 miles/min * 60 = 66,600 mph

Earth was measured in Zacharia 2, Revelations 21

660feet * 12 inches - 7920(diameter of earth) / 1 mile
7920inches - 7920 miles
diameter of New Jerusalem 7920000 ft = 1500miles
1 mile = 5280 feet = 1000 paces of 5.28feet
1.5 miles = 7920 feet

pace/foot = earth/Holy City = 7920/1500 = 1/5.28
